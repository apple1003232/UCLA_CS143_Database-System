Shengzhi Jiang contributes to three input pages 
Hongchen Li contributes to the remaining two browsing pages and one search page.
Both members work together for the testcase part.

In this part of the project, we implement all the required function of the database, including adding new actor, adding new movie, adding actor-movie relations, one search page and two pages showing actor and movie information, respectively.
Besides, we add a css file to make our UI more comfortable to users.

Note that our search.php file serves as the index/homepage.
